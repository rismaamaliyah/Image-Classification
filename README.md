# Image-Classification

This project is an artificial neural network program using TensorFlow. This program is able to recognize hand shapes that form scissors, rock, or paper. Where the project criteria are as follows:
- The dataset must be divided into train set and validation set.
- The size of the validation set must be 40% of the total dataset.
- Must implement image augmentation.
- Using image data generator.
- The model must use a sequential model.
- Model training does not exceed 30 minutes.
- The program was carried out on Google Colaboratory.
- The accuracy of the model is at least 85%.
- Can predict images uploaded to Colab.
